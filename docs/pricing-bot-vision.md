# Pricing Optimization Bot — Vision

## Purpose
Today, pricing analysis at most SaaS companies is slow, spreadsheet-heavy, and reactive.  
Our bot will turn weeks of “What-if” work into minutes by ingesting live ARR/MRR data, modelling price elasticity, and returning clear recommendations (and risks) through a chat or web interface. Success = cut analysis cycle time from ~3 days to <30 minutes, and enable at least one validated price experiment per quarter.

## Core User Stories
1. **RevOps Analyst**  
   *As a RevOps analyst, I type `/price-impact 10%` in Slack and instantly get the projected change in MRR, churn, and NRR, with the key drivers highlighted.*

2. **VP Finance / CFO**  
   *As a CFO, I receive a Monday-morning email summarising upside/downside versus budget at current prices, plus a recommended “next best” price point and its expected ARR delta.*

3. **Product Manager**  
   *As a PM, I upload a CSV of new feature usage and the bot suggests how to map those features into tiers and what incremental price each tier could support, citing historical elasticity.*

## MVP Scope
- Metrics: ARR, MRR, NRR (USD only)  
- One product line, monthly billing cadence  
- Read-only guidance; **no automated pushes to Stripe/billing** yet

## Out of Scope
- CAC, LTV, or marketing spend analysis  
- International currency conversion  
- Fully automated price changes or billing integration in v1
